What is wordle?

Wordle is a popular game bought recently by New York Times, in which each day a new random 5 letter word is picked.
People are given 6 guesses to try and guess what the correct word is.

In traditional wordle, Characters in the correct spot are lit up green, characters in the word but incorrect spot are yellow, and characters not in the word are red.

In this version, due to the lack of console color modification capabilities, characters are surrounded by { } when in the incorrect spot, ( ) when not in the word, and [ ] when in the correct spot.
